        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web developer, that's aiming to get a position as a junior web developer. I've spend the last couple of years studying online via <a target="_blank" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">teamtreehouse.com</a>, while working full-time. It has been a challenging time. Many times I thought "stuff coding! I'm quiting!!". But every time I go to leave, something just keeps pulling me back. It's like an addiction that I can't give up. It's that need to always improve, to just keep moving forward - one more step, and the satisfaction you get from FINALLY understanding/getting something to work!!</p>
        <p>My previous working life has been mainly within the casino/sports betting industry. It taught me a lot about "soft" skills.
          <ul>
            <li>Like how to work well within a team and contribute to achieve a common goal.</li>
            <li>Building a good report with customers, so that I can understand their needs, and provide the best solution for problems.</li>
            <li>The ablilty to learn new skills/products, and then the confidence to be a source of information for customers or other staff members inquiring about those skills/products.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

        <p>I am working on expanding my understanding of JavaScript, with all it's different frameworks and libraries. I will then be looking to learn PHP, followed by either Python or C#. My aim is to work my way up from a junior front end developer to a senior full-stack developer.</p>
